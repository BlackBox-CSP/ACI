====================

# Description
These scripts enable APIC configuration can be done in terminal. It provide a convenient and fast way for users to do APIC configuration.  


# What are those codes:
generic_code: scripts in folder are generic scripts. Each of them does a small function, creating a particular MO.

lab: scripts in this folder are implement scripts. They are implements codes that utilize the generic scripts in the "generic_code" folder and make a big configuration in APIC. (About the installation and usage of the generic code please see the README under folder generic_code.)

template.py: it is not a valid script. But it is a good template for a programmer to start from if he wants to write a customized script. All he needs to do is to redefine the functions in template.py.
